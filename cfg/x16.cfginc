/*
 * KERNAL, BASIC and DOS are built independently, yet the zero page
 * and the $0200-$03FF variables/vectors area are split between them.
 * Therefore, we have this global ld65 "MEMORY" defintion that gets
 * included by all individual .cfg files.
 *
 * The cc65 preprocessor is used to combine the .cfg files. All comments
 * have to be C-style: .cfg "#"-style would throw C preprocessor errors,
 # and C-style comments, unsupported by ld65, get removed by the pre-
 * processor.
