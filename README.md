Commander X16 BASIC/KERNAL/DOS ROM
=======================================

This is the Commander X16 ROM containing BASIC, KERNAL, and DOS. BASIC and KERNAL are derived from the [Commodore 64 versions](https://github.com/mist64/c64rom).

* BASIC is fully compatible with Commodore BASIC V2, with some additions.
* KERNAL
	* supports the complete $FF81+ API.
	* adds lots of new API, including joystick, mouse and bitmap graphics.
	* supports the same $0300-$0332 vectors as the C64.
	* does not support tape (device 1) or software RS-232 (device 2).
* DOS
	* is compatible with Commodore DOS (`$`, `SCRATCH`, `NEW`, ...).
	* works on SD cards with FAT32 filesystems.
	* supports long filenames, timestamps.
	* supports partitions and subdirectories (CMD-style).
* CodeX Interactive Assembly Environment
   * edit assembly code in RAM
   * save program, and debug information
   * run and debug assembly programs

[![License: Mixed](https://img.shields.io/github/license/x16community/x16-rom)](./LICENSE.md)
[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/x16community/x16-rom.svg)](https://github.com/x16community/x16-rom/graphs/contributors)

Each [release of the X16 emulator][emu-releases] includes a compatible build of `rom.bin`. If you wish to build this yourself (perhaps because you're also building the emulator) see below.

> __WARNING:__ The emulator will currently work only with a contemporary version of `rom.bin`; earlier or later versions are likely to fail.

### Building the ROM

Building this source code requires only [GNU Make], [Python 3.7] (or higher) and the [cc65] assembler. GNU Make is almost invariably available as a system package with any Linux distribution; cc65 less often so. 

- Red Hat/CentOS: `sudo yum install make cc65` 
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install make cc65`

On macOS, cc65 in [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which must be installed before issuing the following command:

- macOS: `brew install cc65`

If cc65 is not available as a package on your system, you'll need to install or build/install it per the instructions below.

To check the version of python you have use `python3 --version`.

Once the prerequisites are available, type `make` to build `rom.bin`. To use that with the emulator, copy it to the same directory as the `x16emu` binary or use `x16emu -rom .../path/to/rom.bin`.

*Additional Notes: For users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you will need to have CodeReady builder repositories enabled, for CentOS, this is called PowerTools. Additionally, you will need Fedora EPEL installed as well as cc65 does not come usually within the official repositories.*

### Building/Installing cc65

#### Linux Builds from Source

You'll need the basic set of tools for building C programs:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential git`

The cc65 source is [on GitHub][cc65]; clone and build it with:

    git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
    make -j4    # -j4 may be left off; it merely speeds the build

This will leave the binaries in the `bin/` subdirectory; you may use thes directly by adding them to your path, or install them to a standard directory:

    #   This assumes you have ~/.local/bin in your path.
    make install PREFIX=~/.local

#### Building and Packages for Other Systems

Consult the Nesdev Wiki [Installing CC65][nd-cc65] page for some hints, including Windows installs. However, the Debian packages they suggest from [trikaliotis.net] appear to have signature errors.

Release Notes
-------------
### Release 44 ("Milan")

This is the third release of x16-rom by the X16Community team

* KERNAL
	* **BREAKING CHANGE**
		* The first batch of X16 developer boards were originally shipped without VPB support. The VPB bodge will need to be done before upgrading to ROM version R44 or later. Most of the board owners have been walked through doing the bodge. If you have such an early board (DEV0004-DEV0014) and have not performed the modification, please reach out on the Commander X16 forums or on Discord.
	* Implement a custom callback from the screen editor to intercept, suppress, or remap key events. This is used by the MONITOR to handle scrolling off the top and bottom of the screen when viewing disassembly or memory, but it is also available to [user programs](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-docs/blob/master/X16%20Reference%20-%2002%20-%20Editor.md#custom-basin-petscii-code-override-handler).
	* Move NMI/IRQ handler entry into low RAM, which now requires hardware or emulator VPB support. Prior to this change, VPB was optional. [akumanatt]
	* Add PS/2 Menu key to keycode.inc [stefan-b-jakobsson]
	* Validate nvram checksum before fetching keyboard layout [stefan-b-jakobsson]
	* Improve bounds checking when loading the keymap from nvram
	* In the screen editor, pressing Shift+40/80 (Shift+ScrLock) to change outputs now emits a beep code to indicate which output is selected.  (Low=VGA, Mid=NTSC, High=RGB)
	* Depending on VERA version, kernal ISR now preserves the FX_CTRL register when doing screen updates (cursor blink, mouse sprite).
	* VERA firmwares without a version number or those older than v0.1.1 will display a deprecation warning at boot.
	* Change joystick scan timing to support more third party SNES controllers. [jburks]
	* Prevent the scroll delay when holding Ctrl from clearing the keyboard buffer. This was resulting in dropped characters after pasting code into the emulator on PC.
	* Scale mouse H/V separately based on screen mode.
	* Set mouse pointer to center of display when activating.
	* Preserve L+R outputs for PSG voice 0 around beep function
* CHARSET
	* revert accidental deletion of the butterfly glyph from the main ISO character set.
* DOS
	* Fix bug in `C` copy command [stefan-b-jakobsson]
	* Add `$=L` long directory output, which includes both a human readable size (e.g. "16 KB") and a machine readable exact file size (e.g. `0003fa30`). The line also includes the FAT attribute byte (e.g. `10`), and the modified timestamp in ISO format.
	* Treat `,` comma as an invalid CMDR-DOS filename character, show as `?` in listings.
* BASIC
	* Fix bug with overbroad REN(UMBER) line number parsing
	* new `BANNER` statement
	* Honor new end-of-basic address after call to `MEMTOP`
	* Fix old BASIC garbage collect bug [XarkLabs]
	* Change `OLD` so that it doesn't try to load `AUTOBOOT.X16` [stefan-b-jakobsson]
	* Add YM variant field in the output of the `HELP` command.
	* The `DOS` directory listing command will now case-fold any filename characters which appear as shifted PETSCII if the screen editor is in PETSCII mode, which should mitigate most of the problems with lowercase filenames.
	* `VAL()` can now parse hex (`$xxxx`) and binary (`%xxxxxxxx`) literals
* MONITOR
	* When triggering entry into the monitor via BRK, the displayed PC and registers should now reflect the state upon BRK. The PC will be show as one byte after the BRK instruction.
* GRAPH
	* Accelerate fb_fill_pixels [stople]
	* Fix uninitialized px/py state in console_init
* AUDIO
	* Fix logic bug in `psg_write_fast` routine.
	* Add YM chip type detection logic. `ym_init` can distinguish between a YM2151 and a YM2164.
* UTIL
	* Always enable nvram battery backup when exiting `MENU` [stefan-b-jakobsson]
* BUILD
	* Portability enhancements [dressupgeekout]
	* Drop GEOS bank
	* Remove stale C64 target

### Release 43 ("Stockholm")

This is the second release of x16-rom by the X16Community team

* KERNAL
	* **BREAKING CHANGE**
		* The keyboard protocol between the SMC and the KERNAL has changed. This release requires a firmware update to the System Management Controller on hardware, or on emulator, release R43 or later.
		* This change also affects how the custom keyboard handler vector works (keyhdl). For details, see [Chapter 2 of the Programmer's Reference Guide](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-docs/blob/master/X16%20Reference%20-%2002%20-%20Editor.md#custom-keyboard-keynum-code-handler)
		* **Your Keyboard will not work unless** you are running
			* R43 of both x16-rom and x16-emulator (on emulator)
			* R43 of both x16-rom and x16-smc (on hardware)
	* Build
		* Add git signature to ROM build process
		* Update source to use zp addressing mode where appropriate, which suppresses warnings about using absolute mode for zp addresses.
		* Due to cc65's use of KERNAL RAM locations, `.assert`s were added to try to stablize RAM locations that are hardcoded in cc65's constants file.
	* Hardware support
		* Additional support for display preferences and keymap stored in nvram
		* Support VPB. Hardware with this design sets the hardware ROM bank to 0 immediately before reading a ROM vector. The previous ROM bank will still be in zp `$01` upon interrupt handler entry.
		* Bugfix: fix joysticks always being detected
	* Editor/Display
		* New bordered screen modes to support CRTs
		* New behavior for the END key. END will go to the end of the current line. Shift+END will go to the last line on the screen.
		* PS/2 Delete key now deletes the character underneath the cursor.
		* Blinking cursor should be more visible during movement.
		* Support for automatically setting 240p in NTSC and RGB modes for screen modes that are scaled 2x vertically.
		* New skinny PET style PETSCII and ISO charsets.
		* Replace bold ISO charset [akumanatt]
	* BASIC
		* New logo splash logic for smaller screen modes
		* Show git signature in BASIC splash screen under non-releases
		* `REBOOT` and `RESET` behaviors swapped.
		* Add "I" (instrument) to playstring macros for FMPLAY, PSGPLAY, and friends.
		* Bugfix: If unable to read color pref from nvram, use the default white on blue.
		* Show DOS status after `SAVE` and `DOS` commands.
		* Modify the output of F-keys in the BASIC editor. Removed F9 for keymap cycling.
		* Bugfix: Better support for reading CBM drives' status with the `DOS` command.
		* Make `FRE(n)` always return a positive value.
		* New BANNEX (BASIC annex) for overflow code from BASIC.
		* New commands:
			* `MENU` - load utility
			* `REN` - renumber BASIC program
			* `LINPUT` - Read line from keyboard
			* `LINPUT#` - Read delimited data from file
			* `BINPUT#` - Read fixed-length data from file
			* `HELP` - Show short help blurb and hardware versions.
		* New functions:
			* `POINTER()` - return pointer to variable structure
			* `STRPTR()` - return pointer to string variable's data
			* `RPT$()` - return a string made up of a repeated byte
	* MONITOR
		* Bugfix: Better support for reading CBM drives' status with the `@` command
		* Bugfix: Clear bank flags at init [stefan-b-jakobsson]
	* API
		* Allow `sprite_set_position` to retain existing priority/flip values in attribyte byte 6.
	* GRAPH
		* Fully implement `fb_fill_pixels` [stople]

	* `SCREEN <mode>` (0: 40x30, 2: 80x60, 128: graphics)
	* `PSET <x>, <y>, <color>`
	* `LINE <x1>, <y1>, <x2>, <y2>, <color>`
	* `FRAME <x1>, <y1>, <x2>, <y2>, <color>`
	* `RECT <x1>, <y1>, <x2>, <y2>, <color>`
	* `CHAR <x>, <y>, <color>, <string>`
	* `MOUSE <n>` (0: off, 1: on)
* new BASIC functions:
	* `MX` (mouse X coordinate)
	* `MY` (mouse Y coordinate)
	* `MB` (mouse button; 1: left, 2: right, 4: third)
* new KERNAL calls:
	* `MOUSE`: configure mouse
	* `SCRMOD`: set screen mode
* new PS/2 mouse driver
* charsets are uploaded to VERA on demand
* GEOS font rendering uses less slant for faux italics characters
* misc GEOS KERNAL improvements and optimizations

### Release 33

* BASIC
	* additional `LOAD` syntax to load to a specific address `LOAD [filename[,device[,bank,address]]]`
	* `LOAD` into banked RAM will auto-wrap into successive banks
	* `LOAD` allows trailing garbage; great to just type `LOAD` into a directory line [John-Paul Gignac]
	* new BASIC statement: `VLOAD` to load into video RAM: `VLOAD [filename[,device[,bank,address]]]` [John-Paul Gignac]
	* complete jump table bridge
* KERNAL: memory size detection
* KERNAL: faster IRQ entry
* GEOS: converted graphics library to VERA 320x200@256c

### Release 32

* correct ROM banking:
	* BASIC and KERNAL now live on separate 16 KB banks ($C000-$FFFF)
	* BASIC `PEEK` will always access KERNAL ROM
	* BASIC `SYS` will have BASIC ROM enabled
* added GEOS
* added `OLD` statement to recover deleted BASIC program after `NEW` or `RESET`
* removed software RS-232, will be replaced by VERA UART later
* Full ISO mode support in Monitor

### Release 31

* switched to VERA 0.8 register layout; character ROM is uploaded on startup
* ISO mode: ISO-8859-15 character set, standard ASCII keyboard
* keyboard
	* completed US and UK keymaps so all C64 characters are reachable
	* support for AltGr
	* support for F9-F12
* allow hex and binary numbers in `DATA` statements [Frank Buss]
* switched SD card from VIA SPI to VERA SPI (works on real hardware!)
* fix: `VPEEK` overwriting `POKER` ($14/$15)
* fix: `STOP` sometimes not registering in BASIC programs

### Release 30

* support for 13 keyboard layouts; cycle through them using F9
* `GETJOY` call will fall back to keyboard (cursor/Ctrl/Alt/Space/Return), see Programmer's Reference Guide on how to use it
* startup message now shows ROM revision
* $FF80 contains the prerelease revision (negated)
* the 60 Hz IRQ is now generated by VERA VSYNC
* fix: `VPEEK` tokenization
* fix: CBDOS was not correctly preserving the RAM bank
* fix: KERNAL no longer uses zero page $FC-$FE
